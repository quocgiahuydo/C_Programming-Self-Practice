    // This while loop is implemented in an unusual
    // way, so that it's more clear what happens in
    // assembly.
    while(s2 = *s0, s2 != 0)

        if(s2 > s1)
            s1 = s2;

        // Move the s0 pointer
        // Note that the C compiler will quietly add
        // 4 to the pointer (because integers are 4 bytes).
        // You'll need to add 4 explicitly when you convert
        // to assembly language

// Some more information on the while loop:
// In C, you can connect multiple statements together
// with a comma (most of the time, you'll have
// semicolons).
//
// In the while loop, the "s2 = *s0" gets the
// value pointed to by s0. It's essentially a
// lw $s2, 0($s0)
// assembly statement.
//
// The comparison s2 != 0 after the comma is
// what the while loop will use to decide if we
// should go into the loop and do the work, or
// exit the loop.
//
// Typically, a C programmer might write this instead
// while (*s0 != 0)
//  { .... }
// We're breaking this out into two separate steps
// to make the conversion to assembly language a
// little easier.
//
// Also -- the variable names match up with names
// of registers. In C, you would normally use something
// else for names, so that the code is a little
// easier to read.
